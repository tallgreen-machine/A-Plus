"""
ProgressParallel - Custom joblib.Parallel with progress callback support.

Extends joblib's Parallel to fire progress callbacks after each task completes,
even when running in parallel mode. This allows real-time progress updates
without sacrificing parallel execution performance.

Usage:
    from training.optimizers.progress_parallel import ProgressParallel
    
    results = list(ProgressParallel(
        n_jobs=-1,
        progress_callback=my_callback,
        total=100
    )(
        delayed(my_function)(item) for item in items
    ))
    
    # Callback receives: (completed_count, total_count, best_score)
