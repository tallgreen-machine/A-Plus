# Regime Parameter Explained

## Quick Answer

**The `regime` parameter in the training system is currently a METADATA-ONLY field.** It does NOT affect the training process, optimization, or signal generation. It's stored alongside the trained configuration for future organizational and filtering purposes.

---

## Current Implementation Status

### What `regime` Does NOW

✅ **Stored as metadata** in `training_jobs` and `trained_configurations` tables  
✅ **Used for filtering/querying** configurations later  
✅ **Available in API responses** for display in dashboards  
✅ **Planning/organizational tool** for multi-dimensional training campaigns  

❌ **Does NOT** affect data selection (all historical data is used)  
❌ **Does NOT** modify strategy parameters  
❌ **Does NOT** filter training data by market conditions  
❌ **Does NOT** change optimization objectives  

### Database Values

Current regime values in production:
- `bull` - 7 configurations
- `bear` - 1 configuration  
- `sideways` - 11 configurations (most common, default value)

---

## How It Works Today

### Training Submission

```bash
POST /api/v2/training/start
{
  "strategy": "LIQUIDITY_SWEEP",
  "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
  "exchange": "binanceus",
  "timeframe": "5m",
  "regime": "sideways",  # ← User specifies regime as metadata
  "optimizer": "random",
  "n_iterations": 200
}
```

### Training Flow

```
1. Job Created
   └─ regime='sideways' stored in training_jobs table
   
2. Data Collection
   └─ Fetches ALL available historical data (ignores regime)
   
3. Parameter Optimization
   └─ Tests parameters on ALL data (ignores regime)
   
4. Best Parameters Selected
   └─ Based on metrics across ALL market conditions
   
5. Configuration Saved
   └─ regime='sideways' stored in trained_configurations table
   
6. Later Retrieval
   └─ Can query: "Get all configurations for sideways regime"
```

**Key Point**: The training process is identical regardless of regime value. It's purely organizational metadata.

## What `regime` WILL Do (Future Implementation)

### Phase 1: Data Filtering by Regime (Not Yet Implemented)

**Concept**: Train configurations on specific market conditions

```python
# FUTURE: Classify historical data by regime
historical_data_with_regimes = detect_regimes(data)

# Filter to only bull market periods
bull_data = historical_data_with_regimes[
    historical_data_with_regimes['regime'] == 'bull'
]

# Train parameters optimized specifically for bull markets
optimized_for_bull = optimizer.optimize(
    data=bull_data,  # Only bull regime data
    objective='sharpe_ratio'
)
```

**Benefits**:
- Parameters tuned for specific market conditions
- Better performance in identified regimes
- Avoid training on irrelevant market phases

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented. All training uses full historical data.

---

### Phase 2: Regime-Specific Strategy Selection (Partially Implemented in Archived Code)

**Concept**: Activate different configurations based on current market regime

The archived `trained_assets_manager.py` (now in `/archive/rl_system_deprecated/ml/`) had regime detection logic:

```python
def _detect_current_market_regime(self, symbol: str, exchange: str) -> str:
    """Detect if market is bull/bear/sideways"""
    price_data = get_recent_data(symbol, exchange, periods=100)
    
    # Calculate trend indicators
    metrics = calculate_trend_metrics(price_data)
    
    # Classification logic
    if ma_alignment >= 2 and ema_20_diff > 2 and trend_consistency > 60:
        return 'bull'
    elif ma_alignment <= 1 and ema_20_diff < -2 and trend_consistency < 40:
        return 'bear'
    else:
        return 'sideways'
```

**How it would work**:
1. Detect current market regime in real-time
2. Load configuration trained for that regime
3. Use regime-specific parameters for trading

**Example**:
```python
# Current market analysis
current_regime = detect_regime('BTC/USDT', 'binanceus')  # → 'bull'

# Load bull-optimized config
config = get_config(
    strategy='LIQUIDITY_SWEEP',
    symbol='BTC/USDT',
    exchange='binanceus',
    timeframe='5m',
    regime='bull'  # ← Select bull-trained params
)

# Trade with bull-market parameters
if strategy.check_signal(config.parameters):
    execute_trade()
```

**Status**: 🟡 Detection code exists in archive, but not integrated into V2 training system.

---

### Phase 3: Circuit Breaker Based on Regime Confidence (Documented, Not Implemented)

**Concept**: Reduce risk when regime is uncertain

From `docs/CIRCUIT_BREAKER_GUIDE.md`:

```python
# Regime classifier ensemble
regime_probabilities = {
    "trending": 0.28,
    "ranging": 0.32,
    "volatile": 0.40
}

# No clear regime (max confidence < 0.5)
if max(regime_probabilities.values()) < 0.5:
    # Circuit breaker triggers
    reduce_position_size(by=0.5)  # 50% reduction
    # OR
    pause_trading_until_regime_stabilizes()
```

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented in training or execution systems.

---

## Regime Detection Methodology (From Archived Code)

### Classification Logic

The archived system used these metrics to classify regimes:

```python
# Calculate trend indicators
ma_alignment = count(price > [EMA20, EMA50, SMA100, SMA200])
ema_20_diff = (price - EMA20) / EMA20 * 100
ema_50_diff = (price - EMA50) / EMA50 * 100
trend_consistency = rolling_direction_agreement(50_periods)
volatility = ATR / price

# Bull Market Criteria
if (ma_alignment >= 2 and      # Price above most MAs
    ema_20_diff > 2 and         # Price 2%+ above EMA20
    ema_50_diff > 1 and         # Price 1%+ above EMA50
    trend_consistency > 60):    # 60%+ consistent upward movement
    return 'bull'

# Bear Market Criteria
elif (ma_alignment <= 1 and    # Price below most MAs
      ema_20_diff < -2 and     # Price 2%+ below EMA20
      ema_50_diff < -1 and     # Price 1%+ below EMA50
      trend_consistency < 40):  # 60%+ consistent downward movement
    return 'bear'

# Sideways (Default)
else:
    return 'sideways'
```

**Indicators Used**:
- Moving Average Alignment (EMA20, EMA50, SMA100, SMA200)
- Price vs EMA Distance (percentage)
- Trend Consistency (rolling 50-period directional agreement)
- Volatility (ATR relative to price)

**Status**: 🟡 Code exists but not used in V2 training system.

## Why Regime Detection Isn't Currently Used

### Design Philosophy: "Train on Everything"

The current V2 training system takes a **regime-agnostic approach**:

1. **Use All Historical Data**: Train parameters on all market conditions (bull, bear, sideways)
2. **Let Optimization Find Robust Parameters**: Parameters that work across regimes are more reliable
3. **Avoid Overfitting**: Splitting data by regime reduces training sample size
4. **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and maintain

### Arguments FOR Current Approach

✅ **More Training Data**: Using all historical data provides more samples for optimization  
✅ **Robust Parameters**: Strategies that work in all conditions are more reliable  
✅ **No Regime Prediction Error**: Avoids needing accurate real-time regime classification  
✅ **Simpler System**: Fewer moving parts, less complexity  

### Arguments FOR Regime-Specific Training (Future)

✅ **Better Performance**: Parameters optimized for specific conditions should perform better in those conditions  
✅ **Adaptive Strategy**: Can switch strategies based on current market  
✅ **Risk Management**: Can reduce exposure in unfavorable regimes  
✅ **Professional Approach**: Institutional traders use regime-based models

## How to Use `regime` Today

### 1. Organizational Tool

Use regime to plan multi-dimensional training campaigns:

```python
# Train multiple regime-specific configurations
regimes = ['bull', 'bear', 'sideways']

for regime in regimes:
    submit_training_job(
        strategy='LIQUIDITY_SWEEP',
        symbol='BTC/USDT',
        exchange='binanceus',
        timeframe='5m',
        regime=regime,  # ← Label for organization
        n_iterations=200
    )
```

Later, query by regime:
```sql
SELECT * FROM trained_configurations 
WHERE pair = 'BTC/USDT' 
  AND exchange = 'binanceus'
  AND timeframe = '5m'
  AND regime = 'bull';
```

### 2. Future-Proofing

By storing regime metadata now, you're prepared for when regime-specific training is implemented:

```python
# Future: Activate regime detection
current_regime = detect_regime('BTC/USDT', 'binanceus')

# Load configuration trained for current regime
config = get_best_config(
    symbol='BTC/USDT',
    regime=current_regime,  # ← Use stored metadata
    min_sharpe=1.5
)
```

### 3. Manual Regime Selection

You can manually analyze current market conditions and select appropriate regime:

```python
# Manual analysis
if price > SMA200 and uptrend_for_weeks(4):
    regime = 'bull'
elif price < SMA200 and downtrend_for_weeks(4):
    regime = 'bear'
else:
    regime = 'sideways'

# Use regime-labeled configuration
config = get_config(regime=regime)
```

---

## Comparison with Similar Systems

### Traditional Algo Trading

```python
# Many professional systems use regime detection
if volatility_regime == 'high':
    use_wider_stops()
    reduce_position_size()
elif market_regime == 'trending':
    use_trend_following_strategy()
elif market_regime == 'mean_reverting':
    use_mean_reversion_strategy()
```

### Your Current System

```python
# Simpler: One configuration works in all regimes
config = get_best_config(
    symbol='BTC/USDT',
    # regime not used
)

if strategy.check_signal(config.parameters):
    execute_trade()
```

### Pros/Cons

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Regime-Agnostic (Current)** | Simple, robust, more data | May underperform in specific conditions |
| **Regime-Specific (Future)** | Better performance per regime | Complex, needs accurate detection, less data per regime |

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Short-Term (Keep Current Approach)

1. ✅ Continue using `regime` as metadata for organization
2. ✅ Train multiple configurations with different regime labels
3. ✅ Build up a library of regime-specific configurations
4. ✅ Manually test which regime-labeled configs perform best

**Reasoning**: Current system is working well, producing realistic results. Focus on scale and optimization quality before adding complexity.

### Medium-Term (Implement Regime Detection)

1. Port regime detection logic from archived code to V2 system
2. Add real-time regime classification endpoint
3. Implement automatic regime-based configuration selection
4. Test performance improvement from regime-specific trading

**Implementation Path**:
```python
# New module: training/regime_detector.py
class RegimeDetector:
    def detect_current_regime(self, symbol, exchange) -> str:
        """Classify current market regime"""
        # Port logic from archived trained_assets_manager.py
        
    def classify_historical_regimes(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Add regime labels to historical data"""
        # Rolling window regime classification
```

### Long-Term (Full Regime-Adaptive System)

1. Implement data filtering by regime during training
2. Train ensemble of regime-specific configurations
3. Build regime transition detection (circuit breaker triggers)
4. Implement dynamic position sizing based on regime confidence
5. Add regime performance tracking and decay detection

**Architecture**:
```python
class RegimeAdaptiveTrading:
    def __init__(self):
        self.regime_detector = RegimeDetector()
        self.config_manager = ConfigManager()
        
    def execute(self, symbol: str):
        # Detect current regime
        current_regime = self.regime_detector.detect(symbol)
        regime_confidence = self.regime_detector.confidence()
        
        # Circuit breaker: low confidence
        if regime_confidence < 0.5:
            self.reduce_position_size(0.5)
            
        # Load regime-specific config
        config = self.config_manager.get_best_config(
            symbol=symbol,
            regime=current_regime
        )
        
        # Execute with regime-appropriate parameters
        if self.strategy.check_signal(config.parameters):
            self.execute_trade(config)
```

## Summary

### Current State

**The `regime` parameter is metadata-only.** It has NO effect on training, optimization, or signal generation. It's stored for:
- Organization and filtering
- Future regime-specific functionality
- Manual regime-based configuration selection

### Default Values

- **Database Default**: `'sideways'` (most common in production)
- **API Default**: User must specify (required field)
- **Recommended**: Use `'sideways'` if unsure, or manually analyze market to choose `'bull'`/`'bear'`

### When Regime Will Matter

When these features are implemented:
1. **Data filtering** - Train only on specific regime periods
2. **Regime detection** - Automatically classify current market
3. **Dynamic config selection** - Load regime-appropriate parameters
4. **Circuit breakers** - Reduce risk in unclear regimes

### What to Do Now

1. ✅ Continue using `regime` as organizational metadata
2. ✅ Optionally train multiple configs with different regime labels
3. ✅ Focus on parameter optimization quality (that's what matters now)
4. 🔮 Prepare for future regime-adaptive features by storing regime metadata consistently

---

**Bottom Line**: Regime is currently a label for future use. The training system optimizes parameters across ALL market conditions regardless of the regime value you specify.
